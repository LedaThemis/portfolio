      <p>
        The Iraqi Marshes, also known as the Mesopotamian Marshes, are a unique wetland ecosystem in southern Iraq that has been home to the Marsh Arabs for thousands of years. These marshes represent one of the world's most significant wetland areas and are believed to be the legendary location of the Garden of Eden.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mission is to preserve and document the southern marshes of Iraq through advanced digital technologies, including 3D modeling, photogrammetry, and virtual reality. By creating detailed digital records of this culturally and ecologically significant landscape, we aim to raise awareness about the urgent need for conservation and provide educational resources for future generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project brings together an international team of researchers, students, and heritage preservation specialists committed to documenting and protecting this invaluable cultural and natural heritage site.

              Project Innovation Hub (PIH) is a DAAD-funded online collaborative learning platform that enables students from MENA (Middle East and North Africa) crisis regions to participate in higher education and research in Germany. The platform focuses on digitalization of cultural heritage, using cutting-edge technologies like photogrammetry, laser-scanning, and 3D-modeling to preserve endangered heritage sites.
