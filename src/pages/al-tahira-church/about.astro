        Hosh Al-Bay'ah is a historic Christian compound in Mosul, Iraq, home to the renowned Al-Tahira Churches. The name "Hosh" means courtyard or compound in Arabic, while "Al-Bay'ah" refers to the church. This sacred complex has served as a spiritual and cultural center for Mosul's Christian community for over 150 years, housing the Al-Tahira Orthodox Church (1895 CE), the Al-Tahira Catholic Church (1862 CE), and the historic Tahdhib School. The name "Al-Tahira," meaning "The Pure," honors the Virgin Mary and represents the enduring Christian heritage of Nineveh.

      <p>
        Our mission is to digitally preserve the Al-Tahira Orthodox Church (established 1895 CE) and the Al-Tahira Catholic Church (established 1862 CE) through advanced photogrammetry, 3D modeling, and virtual reality technologies. These historic churches in Mosul have witnessed centuries of history and survived numerous challenges, making their documentation crucial for future generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is led by a dedicated team of students from the University of Mosul located in Nineveh, Iraq, working alongside international heritage preservation specialists to create detailed digital records of these invaluable cultural landmarks.
