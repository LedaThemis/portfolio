        The Old City of Mosul, located on the right coast of the Tigris River, represents one of the most historically significant urban centers in Iraq. For centuries, this ancient quarter was home to iconic landmarks, bustling markets, and diverse communities living in centuries-old buildings that told the story of Mesopotamian civilization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mission is to digitally preserve the Old City of Mosul by documenting the destroyed buildings and architectural heritage that fell victim to conflict. Through advanced photogrammetry, 3D modeling, and digital reconstruction, we are creating a permanent record of the after-effects of war, ensuring that future generations can witness what was lost and understand the importance of protecting cultural heritage in times of conflict.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is led by a dedicated team of students from the University of Mosul located in Nineveh, Iraq, working alongside international heritage preservation specialists to create detailed digital records of these invaluable historical sites before, during, and after their destruction.

        <p>
          The digitalization project focuses on the Old City of Mosul's right coast, documenting destroyed buildings, streets, and landmarks through photogrammetry and 3D reconstruction. By capturing the after-effects of war, we create a comprehensive digital record that serves both as a memorial to what was lost and as a resource for future reconstruction efforts. This work ensures that the architectural and cultural legacy of Old Mosul is not forgotten.
