        <p>Mosul's architecture has evolved over thousands of years, shaped by different civilizations that ruled the region. From ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats to Ottoman mosques and traditional Mosuli houses, the city's heritage reflects a blend of cultures, materials, and construction techniques.</p>

          <p class="text-lg">Mosul, located near Nineveh, was a center of Mesopotamian civilization, particularly during the Assyrian Empire. The Assyrians built massive structures, including ziggurats, which were step-like temple towers used for religious purposes. Palaces were grand, adorned with intricate bas-relief carvings, often depicting kings, gods, and battle scenes. The Palace of Sennacherib in Nineveh, built around 700 BCE, was one of the most impressive examples of Assyrian architecture, featuring large halls, stone walls, and elaborate gateways guarded by Lamassu statues—winged bulls with human heads. <br>
          City fortifications were another defining feature of this era. Nineveh had massive mudbrick walls, reaching up to 25 meters high and strengthened by stone foundations. These fortifications influenced later defensive structures in Mosul. With the rise of the Achaemenid Persians, elements of Persian architecture, such as vaulted halls (iwans) and columned palaces, were introduced, influencing later Islamic designs.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="text-lg leading-10">With the conquest of Alexander the Great, Mosul saw the introduction of Hellenistic architecture. Greek and later Roman influences introduced grid-based city planning, where streets were laid out in an organized manner. Colonnaded streets and agoras (public squares) became common, serving as social and commercial hubs. Greek-inspired temples and public buildings were constructed, though few traces remain today. Under Roman and Parthian rule, fortifications were strengthened, with massive stone walls built to defend against enemy invasions. The influence of the Sassanian Empire (224 - 637 CE) introduced vaulted iwans and Persian-style domes, which would later be integrated into Islamic architecture. Bridges and roads were improved, making Mosul a key trade and military outpost.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="text-lg leading-10">Following the Islamic conquest, Mosul became an important center of Islamic culture and architecture. The Great Mosque of Mosul, built in the 7th century CE, was one of the first mosques in the city, featuring a large open courtyard and hypostyle prayer hall. Islamic calligraphy and geometric patterns became prominent, decorating mosques, madrasas (Islamic schools), and palaces.
            During the Zengid period (11th - 12th centuries CE), Mosul flourished as an intellectual and artistic hub. One of the most famous architectural landmarks from this time is the Al-Nouri Mosque (1172 CE), known for its Al-Hadba Minaret, which had a distinctive leaning structure. This period also saw the construction of madrasas, such as Madrasat al-Zahidiya, which featured courtyards, iwans, and muqarnas (stalactite vaulting).
            City fortifications were expanded, with massive stone gates and towers protecting Mosul. Trade flourished, leading to the construction of bazaars and caravanserais, where merchants from across the Islamic world gathered. The Mongol invasion in 1258 CE brought destruction, but Mosul recovered, incorporating Mongol and Persian influences into its architecture.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="text-lg leading-10">Under Ottoman rule, Mosul developed a unique architectural identity that combined Islamic, Ottoman, and local Mosuli traditions. Mosques during this period adopted the central dome design influenced by Ottoman Istanbul, while minarets became taller and more slender. Traditional Mosuli houses became a defining element of the city's urban fabric. These houses were made of limestone and brick, featuring courtyards with fountains for cooling. A unique feature was the shanashil—wooden balconies with intricate screens, designed to provide privacy while allowing ventilation. Bazaars and caravanserais expanded, with high-vaulted ceilings and stone archways, creating covered markets that protected merchants from the sun. Public bathhouses (hammams) were constructed, serving both hygiene and social functions. Fortifications and bridges were also reinforced, ensuring Mosul's role as a strategic stronghold in the Ottoman Empire.</p>
