### Notable Features

- High-resolution 3D scans of the Al-Tahira Church ruins
- LiDAR and photogrammetry fusion for precise reconstruction
- Interactive visualization tools for exploration and education
- Dataset preservation for academic and restoration use

### Why was this built

The Al-Tahira Church is not only a religious symbol but also a pillar of Iraq's diverse cultural heritage. After being severely damaged during the conflict with ISIS, it became crucial to digitally preserve the site before further deterioration.

### Technology Stack

The project combined drone-based photogrammetry to capture highly detailed models. Software like RealityCapture, Blender, and Unity was then used to reconstruct and present the digital twin of the site.

### Preservation Impact

This effort contributes to global awareness of cultural heritage under threat, supports future reconstruction efforts, and serves as a case study for digital heritage preservation.

### Educational Collaboration

As part of <ExternalLink name="PIH" url="https://pih.education" />, the project also serves as an educational tool, demonstrating how modern technology can document and safeguard the memory of endangered sites.
