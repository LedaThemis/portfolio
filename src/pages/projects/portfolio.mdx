### Notable Features

- Statically generated at build time for CDN-level latency
- Automatically-updating README with Github workflows
- Automated a11y testing with Playwright
- Optimized images with Cloudinary
- Ease in adding new articles with MDX

### Integrating MDX

Using <ExternalLink name="@astrojs/mdx" url="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/" /> to add MDX support was straight-forward.

All that was needed was installing and configuring the integration, and done! (Thanks Astro team!)

### Automated Testing

Thanks to <ExternalLink name="@axe-core/playwright" url="" />, A11Y testing with playwright was super easy.

You can see <ExternalLink name="my current a11y tests file" url="https://github.com/LedaThemis/portfolio/blob/c13927767d3e46b47a7d9487bd0099f8f792358b/tests/a11y.spec.ts" /> which asserts that every page in the website is accessible using the `AxeBuilder.analyze` method, and <ExternalLink name="my current Github worflow setup" url="https://github.com/LedaThemis/portfolio/blob/c13927767d3e46b47a7d9487bd0099f8f792358b/.github/workflows/playwright.yml" /> which sets up a node environment and runs the tests using `pnpm dlx playwright test`

### Optimzied Images

You can view <ExternalLink name="my current optimized image component" url="https://github.com/LedaThemis/portfolio/blob/c13927767d3e46b47a7d9487bd0099f8f792358b/src/components/CldImage.astro" /> which I can import to MDX.

In this component, I basically check whether the link provided is external or internal, and apply the following optimizations:

- Set the delivery type to `fetch` (if it's external)
- Construct an image source set for the image
- Resize each image to fit the current viewport width

### Automatically-Updating README

Updating the README preview image every time I make a visual change to the website is inefficient and time-consuming, so I looked into ways of automating it.

What I currently do is:

- Capture an image of the current website using <ExternalLink name="capture-website - npm" url="https://www.npmjs.com/package/capture-website" />

- Compare to see whether the current image is different than the previous one

- Stop if they're the same

- Otherwise, update the current preview image using the `request` method of <ExternalLink name="@octokit/core - npm" url="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/core" />

And I run the above script on every push to the `production` branch (<ExternalLink name="view my current workflow" url="https://github.com/LedaThemis/portfolio/blob/c13927767d3e46b47a7d9487bd0099f8f792358b/.github/workflows/readme.yml" altText="for automatically updating preview images in README" />)

### Lessons Learned

Learned a lot about Github Actions and Github Workflows, also Astro and MDX, and finally image optimizations.
