### Notable Features

- Track various body measurements
- Track weight
- Sign up with Email, Google, or Github
- Set goals and see how far off you are from them
- View progress as a graph
- View past entries as list in table as rows
- Create recurring reminders (daily, biweekly, weekly, monthly, yearly)

### Why was this built

I've always wanted an app that I can track my progress with, and view that progress in a nicely drawn graph.

### Generating Charts

Using <ExternalLink name="Chart.js" url="https://www.chartjs.org/" /> to generate charts was straight-forward.

We simply generate labels from each data entry, and supply that to the `Line` component of <ExternalLink name="react-chartjs" url="https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/" />

### Displaying a Progress Bar

- Calculate `lineCount` using `Math.ceil(percentage / 100)`
- Generate an array with `lineCount` length
- Use array to generate `div` elements
- Make line darker for each line, `filter: brightness(calculatedBrightess)`

### Creating Reminders

Explored a few options, and the first was creating a <ExternalLink name="custom Next.js server" url="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server" />, but it turns out that wasn't recommended.

So I turned into creating a <ExternalLink name="separate microservice" url="https://github.com/LedaThemis/measura-reminders-webserver" altText="(reminders webserver)" /> which depends on <ExternalLink name="node-cron" url="https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron" /> to make recurring jobs, <ExternalLink name="cron-parser" url="https://github.com/harrisiirak/cron-parser" /> to compute next due date, and <ExternalLink name="hyper-express" url="https://github.com/kartikk221/hyper-express" /> as a backend framework.

### Lessons Learned

Learning about <ExternalLink name="Chart.js" url="https://www.chartjs.org/" /> to plot charts, <ExternalLink name="NextAuth" url="https://nextauth.org" /> for managing authentication, and <ExternalLink name="Prisma" url="example.com" /> for DB operations.

In addition to that, learning about scheduling jobs and recurring tasks.
