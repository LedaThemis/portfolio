### Notable Features

- Track various body measurements
- Track weight
- Sign up with Email, Google, or Github
- Sign up as a guest
- Set goals and see how far off you are from them
- View progress as a graph
- View past entries as list in table as rows
- Create recurring reminders (biweekly, weekly, monthly) [Coming Soon]

### Why was this built

I've always wanted an app that I can track my progress with, and view that progress in a nicely drawn graph.

### Generating Charts

Using <ExternalLink name="Chart.js" url="https://www.chartjs.org/" altText="" /> to generate charts was straight-forward.

We simply generate labels from each data entry, and supply that to the `Line` component of <ExternalLink name="react-chartjs" url="https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/" />

### Displaying a Progress Bar

- Calculate `lineCount` using `Math.ceil(percentage / 100)`
- Generate an array with `lineCount` length
- Use array to generate `div` elements
- Make line darker for each line, `filter: brightness(calculatedBrightess)`
